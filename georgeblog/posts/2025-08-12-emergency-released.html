        <p>so, i just released "emergency" - a... i suppose dark techno track? it's rather outside of what i usually do - 
            while i'm no stranger to straight punchy kicks, they usually still present themselves in the context of
            a rather rigid and strictly melodical composition - something that in my eyes kinda defines my musical style,
            and something that i've been trying to distance myself from for a while now.</p>
            <p>i definetly have to give burial credit for the inspiration here - although the track definetly took much more
                of it's own life in the end, it's his work and my recent binging of it that inspired this track.
      <p style="font-size: small">anyways, you can check out the track on <a href="https://paukowski.bandcamp.com/track/emergency">bandcamp</a>.</p>
            
        <p>cheers.</p>
