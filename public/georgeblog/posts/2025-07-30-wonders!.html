        <p>dear god the site barely works right now.
            so, if somebody was somehow able to find this page - well, hi there!
        </p>
        <p>name's george, i'm a musician and aspiring gamedev, currently working on my first small project 
            <i style="font-size: small">(prob will have to write about that here eventually).</i>
            i also like sporadically tinkering with random stuff, and, well, most recently neocitites, and, 
            by extension, html have kind of randomly entered my sight, and, after like two days - here we are, look ma,
            i have a webpage!
        </p>
        <p>
            i have to say, i was surprised by how much coding in html ended up tickling that funny part of my brain that
            gets exited whenever i write music, or whenever i actually progress with code and not just stare blanckly at a 
            screen - the whole thing is turning out to be really fun, it's this nice balance between control and 
            axessebility<i style="font-size: small">(please doublecheck the spelling)</i> that just kinda makes me hyperfixate
            and flap around exitedly, like a new toy.
        </p>
        <p>
            it's also rather nice to at least somewhat get a whiff of that pre-ass era internet that i honestly kinda 
            missed when i was i kid - i mean, i do remember those sonic fansites on ucoz 
            <i style="font-size: small">(was this a thing outside of russia?...)</i>, but i wasn't really old enough
            to truly enage with then - at the time they were just kinda walls of cool-ass pictures of shadow the hedgehog with a 
            gun. don't really know why, but those sidebars with a ton of those rectangly icons, each with some icon of another
            fansites really stuck with me - i guess to a kid it kinda felt like there's a whole connected world of cool people doing
            cool stuff on those, even if, really, most of those sited were probably already dead by then.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: x-small">
            oh, hey, i can do one for myself now!
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: -15px">
            <a href="https://paukowski.neocities.org/"><img src = "images/george_button.png"></a>
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: x-small; margin-top: -30px">
            yep, that's the life.
        </p>
        <p>
            oh, yeah, i also like to write unnececairly verbose texts like this one sometimes, so yeah, there will be more of that.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: medium">
            so yeah, the site will be kind of a mess for a while probably, i'm still very much learning what the fuck is a
            flexbox and how do i eat it, but, well, if ya somehow found me - stick around if you like what you see, there will be more.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: xx-small">
            probably.
