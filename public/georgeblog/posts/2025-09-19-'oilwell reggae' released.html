      <p>this one was a toughie.</p>
      <p>honestly, for a while there i was almost ready to scrap it and move on, but something 
        was pulling me back to tearing my hair out trying to figure out where do i want the 
        track to go. althought i have to say, listening to it now i'm pretty happy i didn't.
      <p>it's a bit of a break from all the straight kicks i've been pulling lately(although those are 
        not going anywhere) - a track inspired by reggae and dub, quite a bit lighter on the ear.</p>
      <p>i have to say, for a track i've been struggling so much with it's story and themes are shockingly concrete.
        the sludgy tones of the track pretty early on remimded me of machine oil - and with it came the sort of...
        general idea of people living in the oil well, proudly proclaiming themselves as the oil men, with their entire
        cultural identity revolving around the oil.
