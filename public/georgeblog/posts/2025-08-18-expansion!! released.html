      <p>you know, on an occasion the music i do tends to sort of spiral out of control.
        there's always the factor of my music taking a bit of it's own life in the process of elaboration on its
        initial idea, but sometimes it just kinda overpowers me and starts growing and expanding itself in spite
        of whatever i actually planned for it.</p>
        <p>this is one of those.</p>
      <p>i initially planned it to be a sort of more agressive and fast folow-up to my last track, <a href="https://paukowski.bandcamp.com/track/emergency"> "emergency" </a>,
        but after one or two sessions the track started rapidly spiraling into insanity.
      <p>i'm not even sure how to begin to explain some of the decisions i made with it - like, i'm just as puzzled
      as you about how exactly did the death grips sample came to be, what the fuck is that secondary melody that first appears 
      before the first drop, and honestly just in general about what exactly has happened with everything beyond the initial stretch of 40 seconds.</p>
      <p>and yet honestly this is probably one of the best things i've done for a while.</p>
        <p style="font-size: small">as always, the track is available for free on <a href="https://paukowski.bandcamp.com/track/emergency">bandcamp</a>.</p>
