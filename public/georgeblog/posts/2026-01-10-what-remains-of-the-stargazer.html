      <p class ="caption">a solitary man, the stargazer has rarely shown himself in the light of the day - it is then 
          no wonder that his bizzare dissapearence was barely discussed or, for that matter, known.</p>
        
        <p>and just like the man himself, the project i at one point refered to as "stargazer" has pretty much vanished 
            from even my own memory.</p>
        <p>The project was supposed to be a much longer record, an atmospheric record made using retro soundfonts and  shameless
        amounts of reverb, inpired by the likes of yume nikki and the fangames it has spawned. hindsight is 20/20,
        the album haven't really panned out - i struggle to even remember why, but at one point the work just stopped, 
            and i bizzarely have not even thought about it for the longest time, despite how important it was for me at one point.</p>
        <p>this release feels important for me. i can't quite articulate why, but it feels almost like making peace with the past -
        past in which i was in a much worse place, pouring a lot of the pain into what i was making.</p>
        <p>and i'm happy that, even if the time, the place, and the man are gone, i can still give the proper 
            sendoff to what remains of the stargazer.</p>
        <p> the ep is available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SHCc4yuiGE">youtube</a> and <a href="https://paukowski.bandcamp.com/album/what-remains-of-the-stargazer">bandcamp</a>.
