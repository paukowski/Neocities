        <p>alright, so this one took a while. for several reasons.</p>
        <p>once again it was a pretty... unsmooth process. the track started its life as an attempt to do
            something akin to what <a href="https://japanesestreamhardcore.bandcamp.com/track/pray-for-xxxxx">dj myosuke</a>,
            a japaneese hardcore producer i have recently fell in love with does. from the very beginning there were
            some issues - the track just... wasn't really coming along. it sat there for a while as a thirty second loop
            of a single drop, that i was incrementaly changing overtime - this tends to be a pretty frustrating process,
            and with this one specifically it truly felt like carving out the track with my bare teeth, fighting for something
            that slowly starts to show potential, but aclually realising it is painfully slow. 
        <p>but now that we're here - honestly, it's a fun one. pretty early on i have found a sort of... discrepancy -
        the the track somehow ended up radiating a bit of that... like, commercial mainstream cyberpunk dystopia sort of vibe.
        that sort of fantasy of neon megapolises, cool people with mohawks and cybenetic implants for hands, big bad corporations
        and guns - sort of commercial-grade cybervomit that i very much resent, and ended up trying to subvert.</p>
        
        <p>the track is live on <a href="https://paukowski.bandcamp.com/track/20xx-cybervomit">bandcamp</a>.</p>
