      <p>you know, i have a silly habit of just... not making my music public. like, write fully featured tracks,
        from start to finish, mix them, send the track to friends and family and then just do nothing with it.</p>
        <p>it's a habit that i'm trying to break, and the whole rigamarole with the webpage, blog and wherever else
        i post about my music now are first and foremost tools to make me take publishing my music more responsibly, and not
        just sit on it for years. and, well, this track is as good as any to start with.</p>
        
        <p>so, this track has been collecting dust on my drive since june. at the time i was in the middle of
            a half-life binge, and the original half-lifes aesthetics have randomly stuck with me at the time - and this
            track ended up being a vessel for my sudden obsession with its vibes.</p>
        
        <p style="font-size: small">as is tradition, the track is available on <a href="https://paukowski.bandcamp.com/track/blast-pit">bandcamp</a>.</p>
