        <p>it's been pretty melancholic lately. i've just returned back home from a round of pretty intense and exciting work, and the general vibe of early winter
            - sort of cold and pretty unlively - definitely have put me  into this sort of burnout. not really catastrophic
            - though definetly noticable. everything became a bit harder to do, and something as seemingly simple as doing laundry feels much more intimidating than it used to.</p>
            <p>this track, honestly, reflects that shockingly well. it's pretty rare that i'm able to find such a direct correlation between my condition and my music - yet in the noisy, heavily distorted lo-fiish tone and the general i for the first time in a while see a direct emotional reflection.</p>

      <p>the track has started as a random attempt to sample vocals from a  <a href="https://youtu.be/y8nKlSIuAOY?si=CsoQaz3uTBHna9QQ">vocaloid track</a> after hearing it in osu, and grew naturally from there - almost too naturally, to the point that i would say it's my most frictionless track in a very long while.
        i'm starting to see a line between this track and two others - <a href="https://paukowski.bandcamp.com/track/emergency">"emergency"</a> and <a href="https://paukowski.bandcamp.com/track/celebration">"celebration"</a>. i feel like they start to thread into a singular narrative, so i'm starting to wonder if i can maybe tie them together with another track or two and release as an ep.

      <p>the track is out on <a href="https://paukowski.bandcamp.com/track/return-to-haze">bandcamp.</a></p>
